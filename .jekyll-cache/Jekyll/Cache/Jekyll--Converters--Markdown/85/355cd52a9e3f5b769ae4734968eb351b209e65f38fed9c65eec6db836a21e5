I"Ì<p>I am interested in the quantum computer verification problem. When the quantum devices are affected by noise, the computation outcome of quantum computer is not correct. Some of problems to be solved by the quantum computer cannot be checked by a classical computer. In this case, we need to verify the computation outcome. In [Phys. Rev. Lett <strong>115</strong>, 220502 (2015)], I proposed a method to guarantee the computation outcome of a quantum computer. After this paper, many papers employed the method of this paper to verify quantum computers. Then, I extended my method so that it verifies the computation outcome even in the presence of noises. This method can be applied to an implementation of quantum computer.</p>
