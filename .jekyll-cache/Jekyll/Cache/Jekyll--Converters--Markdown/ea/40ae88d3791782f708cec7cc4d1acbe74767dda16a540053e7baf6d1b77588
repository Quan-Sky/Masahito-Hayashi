I"‹<p>This post aims to guide the user how to write news posted.</p>

<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>

<p>We have the following tags for each post:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>layout:</em> currently there is only one choice â€œpostâ€;</li>
  <li><em>title:</em> One can specify a title for each post. If no title is needed, just do not use this tag. This is the common case for â€œPublication newsâ€.</li>
  <li><em>shortnews:</em> if set â€œtrueâ€, then this post will be viewed as a short news, and thus all of its content will be displayed in the â€œHOMEâ€ page. If there is no this tag, only the first paragraph will be displayed in the â€œHOMEâ€ page.</li>
  <li><em>icon:</em> for different types of posts, we can use different small icons. Commonly used choices are: â€œnewspaper-oâ€ and â€œstar-oâ€. You can choose a desired one in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_webapp.asp">Font Awesome Web Application Icons
</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="posts-with-images">Posts with images</h3>

<p>If you want to use an image to represent the post (which will appear on the rightmost of the title), you have to specify the following tags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>image:</em> an url to online image or local uploaded image</li>
  <li><em>image_style:</em> the style of the image, say â€œmax-height: 100px;â€</li>
  <li><em>image_link:</em> when clicking the image, the user will jump to this given link.</li>
</ul>
