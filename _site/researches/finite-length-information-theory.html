<p>Traditionally, information theory has focused on the asymptotic behavior of codes with infinitely long block-length. Recently, many researchers became interested in the ultimate performance of finite-block-length code because nowadays it is possible to construct sufficiently long block length code in the channel coding. Hence, many people are interested in the second order analysis as the approximation of the finite-block length analysis. To resolve this problem, I established a systematic approach to second order analysis by combining the method of information spectrum and the central limit theorem. He applied this approach to the optimal second order coding rates for the source coding and the uniform random number generation. He also developed the second order universal coding theory for the source coding and the uniform random number generation.</p>

<p>Next, I tackled the second order coding rates for discrete memoryless (DMS) channel coding with energy constraint and the channel coding for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), <em>which had been unsolved for 47 years</em>. Due to the optimization of encoder, these problems cannot be solved by a simple application of the above approach. To resolve the difficulty, I revealed two notable relations between the channel coding and the binary hypothesis testing. Employing these relations, he derived the second order coding rates for these problems. Then, comparing the famous Gallager bound, he clarified the superiority of the second order analysis.</p>

<p>Using the information-spectrum method, this paper established the systematic method for second order theory for the channel coding. Then, this paper resolved the second order coding rate for AWGN channel and channel coding with energy constraint hat had been unsolved for 47 years. Although this problem was discussed by Polyanskiy, H. V. Poor, and S. Verdú (2010), this paper preceded them by one year. Due to the strength of this approach, many subsequent papers of the second order employ the proposed systematic method. Also, this paper clarifies the difference between the second order analysis and Gallager bound. Due to the above seminal contributions, this paper was awarded the 2011 IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award.</p>

<p>This paper proposes the use of the information spectrum method for a unified approach for second order asymptotics, which has been applied in many papers as a key idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also extended the above approach to the quantum setting. Firstly, I established the quantum version of the method of information spectrum for the binary hypothesis testing and the quantum data compression. Next, he extended it to the quantum channel coding, which has more serious difficulty due to the non-commutativity. To overcome it, I firstly invented a useful matrix inequality, which has often been referred to as the <em>Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality</em> in many papers for quantum information theory. Using this inequality, I established the relations between the quantum channel coding and the binary quantum hypothesis testing as the quantum version of the above notable relations. Based on these relations, I established the method of the information spectrum for the quantum channel coding, and derived its error exponent, which is the best among the currently known ones. I also constructed quantum universal channel coding by using the group representation theory instead of type method.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this relation clarifies that the key point of second order analysis for quantum channel coding is the binary quantum hypothesis testing. The quantum difficulty for second order analysis is concentrated in the binary quantum hypothesis testing. Inventing the pinching technique, I made the second order analysis for the binary quantum hypothesis testing. Since the pinching technique is a powerful method to overcome the non-commutativity, this method has been often employed in several quantum paper recently. Applying this result, I derived the optimal second order coding rate for information reconciliation from quantum information, which derives the achievability of the optimal second order coding rate for the quantum channel coding.</p>

<p>Non-commutativity causes several kinds of difficulties in quantum information theory. To overcome this problem, this paper derived a novel matrix inequality, which has often been referred to as the Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality” in many papers for quantum information theory. This result brings us the quantum version of the information spectrum method. As another contribution, this paper revealed two useful relations between channel coding and the binary hypothesis testing. One is the relation between existence of a good channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. The other is the relation between the optimal performance of channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. Due to their generality, both relations were used to several papers of channel coding, including the paper for the second order rate of channel coding.</p>

<p>This paper established the foundation of finite-length theory of quantum system.</p>
