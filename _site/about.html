<h3 id="short-biography">Short Biography</h3>

<p>Masahito Hayashi received the B.S. degree from the Faculty of Sciences, Kyoto University, Japan, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Kyoto University, Japan, in 1996 and 1999, respectively. He worked in Kyoto University as a Research Fellow of the Japan Society of the Promotion of Science (JSPS) from 1998 to 2000, and worked in the Laboratory for Mathematical Neuroscience, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN from 2000 to 2003, and worked in ERATO Quantum Computation and Information Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) as the Research Head from 2000 to 2006. He worked in the Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University as Associate Professor from 2007 to 2012. In 2012, he joined the Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University as Professor. In 2020, he joined the Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology as Chief Research Scientist. Also, he worked in Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore as Visiting Research Associate Professor from 2009 to 2012 and as Visiting Research Professor from 2012 to now. He also worked in Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China as a Visiting Professor from 2018 to 2020, and in Center for Quantum Computing, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China as a Research Scientist from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>In 2011, he received <em>Information Theory Society Paper Award (2011)</em> for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5290292/">“Information-Spectrum Approach to Second-Order Coding Rate in Channel Coding”</a>. In 2016, he received the Japan Academy Medal from the Japan Academy and the JSPS Prize from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. In 2017, he was promoted to <strong>IEEE Fellow</strong>.</p>

<p>Assuming only elementary knowledge, this monograph explains many advanced topics in quantum information, quantum channel coding, quantum data compression, and quantum entanglement, etc., including original achievements.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Using the information-spectrum method, this paper established the systematic method for second order theory for the channel coding. Then, this paper resolved the second order coding rate for AWGN channel and channel coding with energy constraint <em>that had been unsolved for 47 years</em>. Although this problem was discussed by Polyanskiy, H. V. Poor, and S. Verdú (2010), this paper preceded them by one year. Due to the strength of this approach, many subsequent papers of the second order employ the proposed systematic method. Also, this paper clarifies the difference between the second order analysis and Gallager bound. Due to the above seminal contributions, this paper was awarded the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/honors/information-theory-paper-award"><strong>2011 IEEE Information Theory
Society Paper Award</strong></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Non-commutativity causes several kinds of difficulties in quantum information theory. To overcome this problem, this paper derived a novel matrix inequality, which has often been referred to as the <em>Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality</em> in many papers for quantum information theory. This result brings us the quantum version of the information spectrum method. As another contribution, this paper revealed two useful relations between channel coding and the binary hypothesis testing. One is the relation between existence of a good channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. The other is the relation between the optimal performance of channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. Due to their generality, both relations were used to several papers of channel coding, including the paper for the second order rate of channel coding.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This paper pointed out the clear connection between the wire-tap channel coding and the channel resolvability. Using this connection, this paper derived an explicit exponent for leaked information by using Arimoto’s exponents. Also, combining the information spectrum approach, this paper revealed the capacity formula of general sequence of degraded wire-tap channels. Since this connection is a very powerful tool for wire-tap channel, many papers for wire-tap channel followed this idea to construct codes for wire-tap channel. Further, this paper proved the conjecture for resolvability capacities for general sequence of channel, which had been an open problem proposed by Han-Verdu in 1993 (13 years).</p>

<p>This paper addresses security analysis when hash functions are applied. It applies hash function to wiretap channel, and constructs a practical code with small encoding and decoding time in finite-length setting. The proposed method can achieve the optimal asymptotic rate for secure key generation.</p>
