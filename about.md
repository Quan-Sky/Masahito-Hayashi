> **M. Hayashi**, [*Quantum Information Theory: Mathematical Foundation*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783662497234), *Graduate Texts in Physics*, Springer (2017). (First Edition: M. Hayashi, Quantum Information: An Introduction, Springer (2006)).

Assuming only elementary knowledge, this monograph explains many advanced topics in quantum information, quantum channel coding, quantum data compression, and quantum entanglement, etc., including original achievements.

> **M. Hayashi**,  "Information spectrum approach to second-order coding rate in channel coding," [**IEEE Transactions on Information Theory**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5290292/), Vol. 55, No. 11, 4947--4966 (2009). 

Using the information-spectrum method, this paper established the systematic method for second order theory for the channel coding. Then, this paper resolved the second order coding rate for AWGN channel and channel coding with energy constraint *that had been unsolved for 47 years*. Although this problem was discussed by Polyanskiy, H. V. Poor, and S. Verdú (2010), this paper preceded them by one year. Due to the strength of this approach, many subsequent papers of the second order employ the proposed systematic method. Also, this paper clarifies the difference between the second order analysis and Gallager bound. Due to the above seminal contributions, this paper was awarded the [**2011 IEEE Information Theory
Society Paper Award**](https://www.itsoc.org/honors/information-theory-paper-award).

Non-commutativity causes several kinds of difficulties in quantum information theory. To overcome this problem, this paper derived a novel matrix inequality, which has often been referred to as the *Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality* in many papers for quantum information theory. This result brings us the quantum version of the information spectrum method. As another contribution, this paper revealed two useful relations between channel coding and the binary hypothesis testing. One is the relation between existence of a good channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. The other is the relation between the optimal performance of channel code and the binary hypothesis testing. Due to their generality, both relations were used to several papers of channel coding, including the paper for the second order rate of channel coding.

This paper established the foundation of *finite-length theory* of quantum system. This paper also derived the second order analysis for secure key generation and data compression with side-information in the quantum setting.

> **M. Hayashi**, "General non-asymptotic and asymptotic formulas in channel resolvability and identification capacity and its application to wire-tap channel," *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*, Vol. 52, No. 4, 1562-1575 (2006).

This paper pointed out the clear connection between the wire-tap channel coding and the channel resolvability. Using this connection, this paper derived an explicit exponent for leaked information by using Arimoto’s exponents. Also, combining the information spectrum approach, this paper revealed the capacity formula of general sequence of degraded wire-tap channels. Since this connection is a very powerful tool for wire-tap channel, many papers for wire-tap channel followed this idea to construct codes for wire-tap channel. Further, this paper proved the conjecture for resolvability capacities for general sequence of channel, which had been an open problem proposed by Han-Verdu in 1993 (13 years).

> **M. Hayashi**, "Exponential decreasing rate of leaked information in universal random privacy amplification," *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*, Vol. 57, No. 6, 3989–4001 (2011).

This paper addresses security analysis when hash functions are applied. It applies hash function to wiretap channel, and constructs a practical code with small encoding and decoding time in finite-length setting. The proposed method can achieve the optimal asymptotic rate for secure key generation.

The study for quantum network coding was studied by this paper. This paper proposed a non-trivial network code over quantum butterfly network.

This paper formalizes quantum state estimation with nuisance parameters. It clarifies the ultimate precision limit in quantum state estimation.
